| Project | Description | Libraries |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
|[P1: Data Preprocessing](P1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb) | Prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The report will be considered when building a credit scoring of a potential customer| pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot|
|[P2: EDA](P2_EDA.ipynb) | Learn how to determine the market value of real estate properties and define the parameters. This will make it possible to build an automated system that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activity.| pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn |
|[P3: Statistical Data Analysis](P3_Statistical_Data_Analysis.ipynb) | Work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget| pandas, matplotlib.pyplot|
|[P4: Data Storage SQL](P4_Data_Storage_SQL.ipynb) | As an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago, the task is to find patterns in the available information and understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.| pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, nltk, scipy |
|[P5: Introduction Machine Learning](P4_Data_Storage_SQL.ipynb) | Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.It is a classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right plan| pandas, sklearn/metrics/ensemble/<br>linear_model/model_selection/tree |
|[P6: Supervised Learning](P6_Supervised_Learning.ipynb) | Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones and predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon| pandas, sklearn/metrics/ensemble/<br>preprocessing/model_selection/tree/ensemble, matplotlib.pyplot|
|[P7: Machine Learning for Business](P7_Machine_Learning_for_Business.ipynb) | You have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique| pandas, sklearn/metrics/ensemble/<br>preprocessing/model_selection/tree/ensemble, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy|
|[P8: Linear Algebra](P8_Linear_Algebra.ipynb) | The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to protect its clients' data. The task is to develop a data transforming algorithm that would make it hard to recover personal information from the transformed data.| pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot |
|[P9: Numerical Methods](P9_Numerical_Methods.ipynb) | Rusty Bargain used car sales service is developing an app to attract new customers. In that app, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. You have access to historical data: technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. Build the model to determine the value.| pandas, numpy, sklearn.preprocessing/linear_model/ensemble,<br> XGBoost, LightGBM |
|[P10: Time Series](P10_Time_Series.ipynb) | Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.| pandas, numpy, sklearn.preprocessing/linear_model/ensemble,<br> statsmodels, seaborn |
|[P11: Machine Learning for Texts](P11_Machine_Learning_for_Texts.ipynb) | Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.| pandas, tqdm, sklearn.preprocessing/metrics,<br> statsmodels, <br> nltk.corpus/tokenize/stem |
|[Final Project](Final-Project.ipynb) | We are working for a telecom operator and our project consist in predicting if someone of our customers are planning to leave the company and try to mantain them through promotional codes and offer them special plans| pandas, numpy, seaborn, <br> sklearn.preprocessing/metrics/linear_model/,<br> statsmodels, <br> datetime, xgboost |
